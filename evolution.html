        The internet wasnt allways as big as it is today. The internet was way smaller, and was only able 
        to transfer a small amount of data from one computer to another(also known as a terminal).
        in the late ninteen hundreds the internet "evolved" and had grown to a much bigger network between
        the average person and institutions, at this point everyone used emails and non-DNS webpages were a thing of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet started out with web 1.0 that had only basic static features like reading documents, and it soon developed and 
       evolved into web 2.0 that has a lot of improvements suchs as read and write capabilities. Built in mp3 and mp4 support ect. 
       Soon the internet will move over to web 3.0, that will have semantic search capabilties and will be focused on being highly mobile.
      </p>

       Today the internet is way more than anyone would have excpected 30 years ago. It started out as a small network between 2 terminals 
       and ended up being a massive network between trillions of devices world wide. You can be anywhere in the world and connect to the internet
       at anytime. Everyone holds unlimited knownledge in their pocket.
