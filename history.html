        <h1>Client-Side and Server-Side Engineering</h1>
      <p>
        ‘Client-side’ refers to everything  that occurs on the client or end user device in a web application (Cloudfare, 2021). This includes everything the users sees, as well as any actions performed by the application within the user’s browser (Cloudfare, 2021). The client-side is also commonly known as the ‘front-end’, however, these two terms and their meanings do differ from one another as ‘client-side’ mainly refers to the location where processes occur, whereas ‘front-end’ refers to the various types of processes that run the client-side (Cloudfare, 2021).
        Client-side developers, also called front-end programmers, create visually appealing, practical and useful applications as well as dynamic websites (Weinstein, 2020). They are the individuals primarily responsible for all visible and interactable parts of a website, and common scripting languages utilized by these front-end programmers include JavaScript, HTML and CSS (Weinstein, 2020).

      <p>
        ‘Server-side’ refers to everything that occurs on the server itself, and not on the client or end user device (Cloudfare, 2021). In the past, all business logic, including process such as rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, push notifications and identity authentication, used to occur server-side, but due to latency issues, modern applications now run more code client-side (Cloudfare, 2021). ‘Backend’ is also a term used as reference to server-side, although the term mainly only refers to the types of processes running, whereas the term ‘server-side’ refers to the specific location where processes run (Cloudfare, 2021).
        Server-side developers, or backend developers, design, maintain and develop the server-side code required for the exchange of data, and ensure that all process run properly on application servers (Weinstein, 2020).
