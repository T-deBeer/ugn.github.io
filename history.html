        <h1>History of the Internet</h1>
      <p>
       The internet was a static network designed to send a small number of bytes or a short message between two terminals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the internet widened in its scope to include the IT capabilities of various enterprises and institutions, this caused immense growth, so much so that the internet was no longer state-controlled but turned into the largest computer network in the world, containing 50000 sub-networks, 4 million systems and 70 million users, and the numbers have not stopped growing since.<br><br>With the movement from web 1.0, which include static web pages, brochure ware and no communities, to web 2.0, which has social media, keyword searching and a rich user experience, caused yet another revolution in the internetâ€™s shot history. Today the development of the internet is predominantly shaped by mobile communication and moving to web 3.0, which will be highly mobile and have semantic search functionality.<br><br>We are no longer tied down to a single device, with the introduction of the cloud, the internet allows us to use any device at any time and still be connected to everything. With the internet still growing at an exponentially fast rate there is no telling where it would end.  </p>
