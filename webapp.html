                           <p class="set-p-font color-white">A Web Application Architecture is merely a blueprint for the simultaneous interaction between the different systems of a web application, namely components, databases, user interfaces, servers, clients, excreta (Dhaduk, 2021). It also displays the logical connection between the server-side and client-side of the application (Dhaduk, 2021).</p>

                           <p class="set-p-font color-white">The Web Application Architecture is of most importance in order to deliver a fast and effective user experience  through improved performance of the application by adapting to specific requirements effectively (Dhaduk, 2021). It also makes it possible to work on many modules of the web application structure at the same time and implement new functions without completely changing the whole structure (Dhaduk, 2021). Furthermore, it improves security by applying separate security measures to each of the divided blocks within the structure (Dhaduk, 2021).</p>

                   <p class="view-inline">All web Applications are made out of two primary components, namely the server-side and the client-side (Dhaduk, 2021). The client-side is written in HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript and it is where the user interface gets created (Dhaduk, 2021). The server-side is written in PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. and responds to HTTP requests and controls business logic (Dhaduk, 2021). The server-side is the backend in </p>

                   <p class="view-inline"> and the client-side is the frontend. You can also determine on which of these two components rendering (engineering) takes place which we will explore later. </p>

                  <p class="view-inline">, modern web architectures are divided into layers, where the most common are presentation (The frontend), business (The web server that does all the calculations), persistence (The file system that accesses the data for the web server), and database (Simply the Database that stores data) (Dhaduk, 2021). The number of layers can be reduced or increased depending on the complexity of the web application by combining layers or dividing layers into sub-layers (Dhaduk, 2021). Each layer functions independently and makes changes easier by changing a single layer instead of the entire system (Dhaduk, 2021). </p>

                  <p>There also exists different models of web applications that are determined by the amount of servers and databases that are connected to the application (Dhaduk, 2021). A web application that has a single server and database can crash more easily if one of these components crashes, thus it is best to have multiple servers and databases that can take over when one crashes or recover data (Dhaduk, 2021).</p>
                  <p>It is important to consider the flexibility, effeciency, scalability, reliability, reusability, bug-detection methods, etc. when creating the web application architecture for the most efficient web application (Dhaduk, 2021).</p>
