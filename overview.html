        The World Wide Web, commonly referred to as the web, is a space where
        documents and other resources are identified by (Uniform Resource
        Identifiers)URIs, also referred to as URLs, linked by hypertext links
        and accessed through the internet (Lumens Learning, n.d.).<br><br>It was
        created by Timothy Berners Lee on March 12, 1989 (Tutorial Point, n.d.).
        Timothyâ€™s idea behind the web originated as a way for researcher to
        easily and efficiently work together. Timothy originally proposed the
        idea at CERN, a European organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva
        (Tutorial Point, n.d.).<br><br>A common misconception is that the web and the
        internet is the same, however they are separate entities, the internet
        is a global system of connected computer networks. In contrast the web
        is one of the services transferred over the networks of the internet
        (Lumens Learning, n.d.).<br><br>The web utilizes various recourses to structure
        a webpage, these include identifiers, syntax data interchanges and
        several other technologies to create a full-fledged webpage (Tutorial
        Point, n.d.).<br><br>The web works on a client-server approach, the steps to
        this approach is as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>User enters a URL of the webpage.</li><br>
          <li>The browser sends a request the Domain Name Server(DNS) for the IP address to the webpage URL.</li><br>
          <li>If the IP address is received the browser requests the webpage from the web server using HTTP protocol.</li><br>
          <li>The web server searches for the webpage requested by the HTTP request if it is found it returns it and closes the HTTP connection.</li><br>
          <li>The browser then receives the webpage and then interprets it and then displays the contents of the website.</li>
        </ol>
